## Cleveland State University, C/C++ for Systems Programmers Course

This repository is to share solutions for the CIS 340 course at CSU. This repository is for the purpose of assisting those who may need assistance with their work or who want to help others. Please make sure you are not doing the following:

1. Do not edit code without making sure it works! It would be hard to understand an issue if your code is incomplete.
2. Do not post solutions to problems without explaining _why_. Understanding why is far more important for taking quizzes and exams and is generally more beneficial. Comments are very beneficial. 
3. Please do not post the solutions to a lab simply to share them. That is cheating, and is not the point of this repository. Use this as a resource, not a solution set. Solutions can be posted _after_ the due date for a problem.
